# Data-Cleaning-project

The overall goal of this project is to develop a website where I can upload datasets and execute a few basic data cleaning steps. 

Features:
- Edit column names
- Treat empty rows (replace with mean, median or mode)
- Delete empty rows

Long-term goals:
- Input data of any data type and provide multiple options to convert final data into different data file types (csv, python file, etc.)
